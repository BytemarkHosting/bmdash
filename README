# Bytemark Dashboards (bmdash)

Byteamrk's Dashboard Software

## About
Status screens, TV's flashing numbers and annoying noises! What is going on at
Bytemark, well let's look at the Dashboards!

`bmdash` attempts to be a simple and not at all complexing and vexing dashboard 
system that allows users to easily add and manage multiple dashboards, as well 
as making it easy to extend. Hahahaha, I will let you be the judge of our 
success.
