# Bytemark Dashboards (bmdash)

Byteamrk's Dashboard Software

## About
Status screens, TV's flashing numbers and annoying noises! What is going on at
Bytemark, well let's look at the Dashboards!

`bmdash` attempts to be a simple and not at all complexing and vexing dashboard 
system that allows users to easily add and manage multiple dashboards, as well 
as making it easy to extend. Hahahaha, I will let you be the judge of our 
success.

## How to use

TODO:: Write software, then write about how to use it

## Development And Hacking

[Vagrant][0] is used to bring up a dev envrioment quickly. You don't have to use
this but it is there for convience. You need to have [VirtualBox][1] installed and 
the [Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack][2].

Hopefully all you need to do is install vagrant, and run `vagrant up` and it 
should do the rest for you. You can access the VM over SSH by running
`vagrant ssh` and it should have the network address `10.0.0.123`
